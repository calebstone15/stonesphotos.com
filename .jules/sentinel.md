## 2025-10-27 - [Hardcoded Configuration Pattern]
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded API keys and Service IDs (EmailJS) scattered across multiple files (`script.js`, `bookings.html`).
**Learning:** Even "public" keys should be centralized. Scattering them violates DRY and makes rotation/maintenance difficult. It also increases the risk of accidentally committing a real secret if the pattern is followed for other services.
**Prevention:** Use a centralized `config.js` or environment variable injection (if using a bundler) to manage all external service credentials and identifiers.
